ALGORITHM: Smart Workout Upload Validation

1. IMAGE DUPLICATE DETECTION:
   - Calculate image hash (using canvas pixel data)
   - Check against stored hashes in localStorage
   - If hash exists → REJECT ("You've already uploaded this workout")
   - If similar hash exists → REJECT ("Similar workout already uploaded")

2. ENHANCED FITNESS VALIDATION:
   - OCR extract text
   - Calculate fitness keyword density (must be >30%)
   - Check for numeric patterns (calories, steps, time formats)
   - Validate app UI structure (headers, metrics layout)
   - Require minimum 3 fitness metrics detected

3. ANTI-CHEAT MEASURES:
   - Track upload timestamps (prevent rapid uploads)
   - Validate workout progression (stats shouldn't jump too much)
   - Cross-reference with previous workouts for consistency

4. CONFIDENCE SCORING:
   Total Score = OCR_confidence + Fitness_keywords + UI_patterns + Numeric_data
   Minimum required score: 75/100

5. STORAGE:
   - Store approved image hashes
   - Track user upload patterns
   - Log validation scores for debugging
